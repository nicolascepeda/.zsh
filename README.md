# ZSH dot files

This is my personal zsh setup. I'm aware that further automation is possible, e.g. Holman's 
[dotfiles][url_holman] project.

You're free to do whathever you want with my dotfiles! Fork it, modify it, share it, ...

# Installation
Clone the repo to your home folder.

    $ cd ~
    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:instilled/.zsh.git

Now symlink `.zsh/zshrc` to `~` as follows

    $ cd ~
    $ ln -s .zsh/zshrc .zshrc

That's it!

You may want to change your default shell to zsh. In OSx type `chsh -s /bin/zsh`. For Linux the same command should do it.
